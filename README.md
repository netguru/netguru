### Pre-commit hook for git

It checks current changes for unwanted stuff (aka *badcode*) and prevents from including it into repository).

In order to install, run this command in the main directory of your app:
`rake netguru:install:precommit`

You don't usually remove this hook, but when you do...
`rake netguru:uninstall:precommit`
